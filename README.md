# Grammar Processor

==========================================

This is a library for processing grammars in [GRXML] (https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/) format and [JJSGF](https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/articles/360048936511-JJSGF-Grammars) format, creating railroad diagrams representing all possible outcomes of the grammar.
